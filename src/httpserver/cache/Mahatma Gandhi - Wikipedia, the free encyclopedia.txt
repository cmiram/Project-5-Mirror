Assuming leadership of the <a href="/wiki/Indian_National_Congress" title="Indian National Congress">Indian National Congress</a> in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending <a href="/wiki/Dalit" title="Dalit">untouchability</a>, but above all for achieving <i><a href="/wiki/Swaraj" title="Swaraj">Swaraj</a></i> or self-rule.

The South African experience exposed handicaps to Gandhi that he had not known about.

</p><p>In South Africa, Gandhi faced the discrimination directed at all coloured people.

</p><p>In 1906, the <a href="/wiki/Transvaal_Colony" title="Transvaal Colony">Transvaal</a> government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian population. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of <i>Satyagraha</i> (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time.<sup id="cite_ref-Rai2000_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rai2000-45">[45]</a></sup> He urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. The community adopted this plan, and during the ensuing seven-year struggle, thousands of Indians were jailed, flogged, or shot for striking, refusing to register, for burning their registration cards or engaging in other forms of nonviolent resistance. The government successfully repressed the Indian protesters, but the public outcry over the harsh treatment of peaceful Indian protesters by the South African government forced South African leader <a href="/wiki/Jan_Christiaan_Smuts" title="Jan Christiaan Smuts" class="mw-redirect">Jan Christiaan Smuts</a>, himself a philosopher, to negotiate a compromise with Gandhi. Gandhi's ideas took shape, and the concept of <i>Satyagraha</i> matured during this struggle.

In 1915, Gandhi returned to India permanently. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and organiser. He joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by <a href="/wiki/Gopal_Krishna_Gokhale" title="Gopal Krishna Gokhale">Gopal Krishna Gokhale</a>. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system.

</p><p>Gandhi took leadership of Congress in 1920 and began a steady escalation of demands (with intermittent compromises or pauses) until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise that and more negotiations ensued, with Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consulting anyone. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders for the duration. Meanwhile the Muslim League did cooperate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land, with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

<p>Gandhi's first major achievements came in 1918 with the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Champaran_and_Kheda_Satyagraha&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha (page does not exist)">Champaran and Kheda agitations</a> of Bihar and Gujarat. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.<sup id="cite_ref-Hardiman2001_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hardiman2001-64">[64]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1918, <a href="/wiki/Kheda" title="Kheda">Kheda</a> was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes.

A social boycott of <i>mamlatdars</i> and <i>talatdars</i> (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown1974_67-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brown1974-67">[67]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Khilafat_movement">Khilafat movement</span></h3>
<p>In 1919 Gandhi, with his weak position in Congress, decided to broaden his base by increasing his appeal to Muslims. The opportunity came from the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Khilafat_movement&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Khilafat movement (page does not exist)">Khilafat movement</a>, a worldwide protest by Muslims against the collapsing status of the <a href="/wiki/Caliph" title="Caliph">Caliph</a>, the leader of their religion.

</p><p>Gandhi always fought against "communalism", which pitted Muslims against Hindus in politics, but he could not reverse the rapid growth of communalism after 1922.

<p>With Congress now behind him in 1920, Gandhi had the base to employ noncooperation, nonviolence and peaceful resistance as his "weapons" in the struggle against the <a href="/w/index.php?title=British_Raj&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="British Raj (page does not exist)">British Raj</a>.

<p>In December 1921, Gandhi was invested with executive authority on behalf of the Indian National Congress. Under his leadership, the Congress was reorganised with a new constitution, with the goal of <i>Swaraj</i>. Membership in the party was opened to anyone prepared to pay a token fee. A hierarchy of committees was set up to improve discipline, transforming the party from an elite organisation to one of mass national appeal. Gandhi expanded his nonviolence platform to include the <a href="/wiki/Swadeshi_movement" title="Swadeshi movement"><i>swadeshi</i> policy</a>—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Khadi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Khadi (page does not exist)">khadi</a></i> (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles.

In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British educational institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake <a href="/w/index.php?title=British_honours_system&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="British honours system (page does not exist)">British titles and honours</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Shashi1996_82-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shashi1996-82">[82]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Non-cooperation" enjoyed widespread appeal and success, increasing excitement and participation from all strata of Indian society.

Fearing that the movement was about to take a turn towards violence, and convinced that this would be the undoing of all his work, Gandhi called off the campaign of mass civil disobedience.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> This was the third time that Gandhi had called off a major campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-GreatSoulReview_84-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GreatSoulReview-84">[84]</a></sup> Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.

<p>Gandhi stayed out of active politics and, as such, the limelight for most of the 1920s. He focused instead on resolving the wedge between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress, and expanding initiatives against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty. He returned to the fore in 1928. In the preceding year, the British government had appointed a new constitutional reform commission under Sir John Simon, which did not include any Indian as its member. The result was a boycott of the commission by Indian political parties. Gandhi pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India <a href="/w/index.php?title=Dominion&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dominion (page does not exist)">dominion</a> status or face a new campaign of noncooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal.

This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930. This was highlighted by the famous Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where he marched <a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Convert&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Convert (page does not exist)">Template:Convert</a> from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself.

<p>Congress in the 1920s appealed to peasants by portraying Gandhi as a sort of <a href="/wiki/Messiah" title="Messiah">messiah</a>, a strategy that succeeded in incorporating radical forces within the peasantry into the nonviolent resistance movement.

Similar messianic imagery appeared in popular songs and poems, and in Congress-sponsored religious pageants and celebrations.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Congress_politics">Congress politics</span></h3>
<p>In 1934 Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership.

<p>Gandhi initially favoured offering "nonviolent moral support" to the British effort when <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> broke out in 1939, but the Congressional leaders were offended by the unilateral inclusion of India in the war without consultation of the people's representatives.

</p><p>Gandhi was criticised by some Congress party members and other Indian political groups, both pro-British and anti-British. Some felt that not supporting Britain more in its struggle against Nazi Germany was unethical. Others felt that Gandhi's refusal for India to participate in the war was insufficient and more direct opposition should be taken, while Britain fought against Nazism, it continued to refuse to grant India Independence. <i>Quit India</i> became the most forceful movement in the history of the struggle, with mass arrests and violence on an unprecedented scale.<a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sfn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sfn (page does not exist)">Template:Sfn</a>

<p>Historian R.B. Cribb argues that Gandhi's thought evolved over time, with his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy. In London he committed himself to truthfulness, temperance, chastity, and vegetarianism. His return to India to work as a lawyer was a failure, so he went to South Africa for a quarter century, where he absorbed ideas from many sources, most of them non-Indian.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup> Gandhi grew up in an eclectic religious atmosphere and throughout his life searched for insights from many religious traditions.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup> He was exposed to <a href="/wiki/Jainism" title="Jainism">Jain</a> ideas through his mother who was in contact with Jain monks. Themes from Jainism that Gandhi absorbed included asceticism; compassion for all forms of life; the importance of vows for self-discipline; vegetarianism; fasting for self-purification; mutual tolerance among people of different creeds; and "syadvad", the idea that all views of truth are partial, a doctrine that lies at the root of Satyagraha.<sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup> He received much of his influence from Jainism particularly during his younger years.<sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup>
</p><p>Gandhi's London experience provided a solid philosophical base focused on truthfulness, temperance, chastity, and vegetarianism. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial and he could not make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-Crib1985_138-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Crib1985-138">[138]</a></sup> N.

</p><p>Balkrishna Gokhale argues that Gandhi took his philosophy of history from Hinduism and Jainism, supplemented by selected Christian traditions and ideas of Tolstoy and Ruskin. Hinduism provided central concepts of God's role in history, of man as the battleground of forces of virtue and sin, and of the potential of love as an historical force. From Jainism, Gandhi took the idea of applying nonviolence to human situations and the theory that Absolute Reality can be comprehended only relatively in human affairs.<sup id="cite_ref-BGB_142-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BGB-142">[142]</a></sup>

<p>Gandhi dedicated his life to the wider purpose of discovering truth, or <i><a href="/wiki/Satya" title="Satya">Satya</a></i>. He tried to achieve this by learning from his own mistakes and conducting experiments on himself. He called his autobiography <i><a href="/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth" title="The Story of My Experiments with Truth">The Story of My Experiments with Truth</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Johnson2006_148-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Johnson2006-148">[148]</a></sup>
</p><p>Bruce Watson argues that Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic ideal of self-realization, and notes it also contains Jain and Buddhist notions of nonviolence, vegetarianism, the avoidance of killing, and 'agape' (universal love). Gandhi also borrowed Christian-Islamic ideas of equality, the brotherhood of man, and the concept of turning the other cheek.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson_149-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Watson-149">[149]</a></sup>
</p><p>Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said "God is Truth". He would later change this statement to "Truth is God". Thus, <i>satya</i> (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is "God".<sup id="cite_ref-Parel2006_150-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Parel2006-150">[150]</a></sup>
</p><p>The essence of <a href="/wiki/Satyagraha" title="Satyagraha">Satyagraha</a> (a name Gandhi invented meaning "adherence to truth"<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup>) is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves and seeks to transform or "purify" it to a higher level. A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a "silent force" or a "soul force" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous "<a href="/w/index.php?title=I_Have_a_Dream&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="I Have a Dream (page does not exist)">I Have a Dream</a>" speech).

</p><p>Gandhi wrote: "There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant.

Gandhi realised later that this level of nonviolence required incredible faith and courage, which he believed everyone did not possess.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Muslims">Muslims</span></h4>
<p>One of the Gandhi's major strategies, first in South Africa and then in India, was uniting Muslims and Hindus to work together in opposition to British imperialism. In 1919–22 he won strong Muslim support for his leadership in the <a href="/wiki/Khilafat_Movement" title="Khilafat Movement">Khilafat Movement</a> to support the historic <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Caliphate" title="Ottoman Caliphate">Ottoman Caliphate</a>.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Jews">Jews</span></h4>
<p>In 1931, he suggested that while he could understand the desire of European Jews to emigrate to Palestine, he opposed any movement that supported <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British colonialism</a> or violence. Muslims throughout India and the Middle East strongly opposed the Zionist plan for a Jewish state in Palestine, and Gandhi (and Congress) supported the Muslims in this regard. By the 1930s all major political groups in India opposed a Jewish state in Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vegetarianism_and_food">Vegetarianism and food</span></h3>
<p>Stephen Hay argues that Gandhi in London looked into numerous religious and intellectual currents.

<p>Gandhi used <a href="/wiki/Fasting" title="Fasting">fasting</a> as a political device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as a political action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However his final fast in 1948, after India was independent, was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup>
</p><p>Alter argues that Gandhi's fixation on diet and celibacy were much deeper than exercises in self-discipline. Rather, his beliefs regarding health offered a critique of both the traditional Hindu system of ayurvedic medicine and Western concepts. This challenge was integral to his deeper challenge to tradition and modernity, as health and nonviolence became part of the same ethics.<sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Celibacy_and_experiments_with_celibacy_.28Bramhacharya.29">Celibacy and experiments with celibacy (Bramhacharya)</span></h3>
<p>In 1906 Gandhi, although married and a father, vowed to abstain from sexual relations. In the 1940s, in his mid-seventies, he brought his grandniece Manubehn to sleep naked in his bed as part of a spiritual experiment in which Gandhi could test himself as a "brahmachari." Several other young women and girls also sometimes shared his bed as part of his experiments.<sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup> Gandhi's behaviour was widely discussed and criticised by family members and leading politicians, including Nehru. Some members of his staff resigned, including two editors of his newspaper who left after refusing to print parts of Gandhi's sermons dealing with his sleeping arrangements. But Gandhi said that if he wouldn't let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness.<sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup>

According to Howard, Gandhi "developed his discourse as a religious renouncer within India's traditions to confront repressive social and religious customs regarding women and to bring them into the public sphere, during a time when the discourse on celibacy was typically imbued with masculine rhetoric and misogynist inferences.... his writings show a consistent evolution of his thought toward creating an equal playing field for members of both sexes and even elevating women to a higher plane—all through his discourse and unorthodox practice of <i><a href="/wiki/Brahmacharya" title="Brahmacharya">brahmacharya</a></i>."<sup id="cite_ref-howard2013_184-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-howard2013-184">[184]</a></sup><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Rp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Rp (page does not exist)">Template:Rp</a>

Gandhi's educational policies reflected <i>Nai Talim</i> ('Basic Education for all'), a spiritual principle which states that knowledge and work are not separate. It was a reaction against the British educational system and colonialism in general, which had the negative effect of making Indian children alienated and career-based; it promoted disdain for manual work, the development of a new elite class, and the increasing problems of industrialisation and urbanisation. The three pillars of Gandhi's pedagogy were its focus on the <i>lifelong character</i> of education, its <i>social character</i> and its form as a <i>holistic process</i>.

Rudolph argues that after a false start in trying to emulate the English in an attempt to overcome his timidity, Gandhi discovered the inner courage he was seeking by helping his countrymen in South Africa. The new courage consisted of observing the traditional Bengali way of "self-suffering" and, in finding his own courage, he was enabled also to point out the way of 'Satyagraha' and 'ahimsa' to the whole of India.<sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup> Gandhi's writings expressed four meanings of freedom: as India's national independence; as individual political freedom; as group freedom from poverty; and as the capacity for personal self-rule.<sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup>

His idea was that true <a href="/wiki/Swaraj" title="Swaraj">self-rule</a> in a country means that every person rules his or herself and that there is no state which enforces laws upon the people.<sup id="cite_ref-GandhiTolstoy1987_193-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GandhiTolstoy1987-193">[193]</a></sup>
</p><p>This would be achieved over time with nonviolent conflict mediation, as power is divested from layers of hierarchical authorities, ultimately to the individual, which would come to embody the ethic of nonviolence. Rather than a system where rights are enforced by a higher authority, people are self-governed by mutual responsibilities. On returning from South Africa, when Gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, "in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties."<sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup>
