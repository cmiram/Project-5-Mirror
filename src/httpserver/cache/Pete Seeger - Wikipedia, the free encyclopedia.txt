Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album "in bad taste," though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it.

<p>Seeger's critics, however, have continued to bring up the Almanacs' repudiated <i>Songs for John Doe</i>. In 1942, a year after the <i>John Doe</i> album's brief appearance (and disappearance), the FBI decided that the now-pro-war Almanacs were still endangering the war effort by subverting recruitment. According to the New York <i>World Telegram</i> (February 14, 1942), Carl Friedrich's 1941 article "The Poison in Our System" was printed up as a pamphlet and distributed by the Council for Democracy (an organization that Friedrich and <a href="/wiki/Henry_Luce" title="Henry Luce">Henry Luce</a>'s right hand man, <a href="/w/index.php?title=C._D._Jackson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="C.

</p><p>His critics have also tried to downplay the sincerity of Seeger's “anti-war” sentiments, and even to suggest that he was a supporter of Nazi Germany, by asserting that Seeger was only anti-war in the early 1940s because at the time the Soviet Union had a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, and that he immediately became pro-war after the USSR was invaded.  They support this assertion by pointing out, incorrectly, that the Weavers' album Dear Mr. President (supporting the war effort) was released “shortly” after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.  However, Dear Mr. President was actually released a year later, in June 1942, six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States’ entry into the war.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

Its personnel included, at various times: <a href="/wiki/Woody_Guthrie" title="Woody Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bess_Lomax_Hawes&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bess Lomax Hawes (page does not exist)">Bess Lomax Hawes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sis_Cunningham" title="Sis Cunningham">Sis Cunningham</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Josh_White&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Josh White (page does not exist)">Josh White</a>, and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sam_Gary&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sam Gary (page does not exist)">Sam Gary</a>. As a controversial Almanac singer, the 21-year-old Seeger performed under the stage name "Pete Bowers" to avoid compromising his father's government career.
</p><p>In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as <a href="/wiki/The_Weavers" title="The Weavers">the Weavers</a>, named after the title of an 1892 play by <a href="/wiki/Gerhart_Hauptmann" title="Gerhart Hauptmann">Gerhart Hauptmann</a> about a workers' strike (which contained the lines, "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, <a href="/wiki/Ronnie_Gilbert" title="Ronnie Gilbert">Ronnie Gilbert</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Fred_Hellerman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Fred Hellerman (page does not exist)">Fred Hellerman</a>; later <a href="/w/index.php?title=Frank_Hamilton_(musician)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Frank Hamilton (musician) (page does not exist)">Frank Hamilton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Erik_Darling" title="Erik Darling">Erik Darling</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bernie_Krause&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bernie Krause (page does not exist)">Bernie Krause</a> serially took Seeger's place. In the atmosphere of the 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major <a href="/w/index.php?title=Chart-topper&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Chart-topper (page does not exist)">hits</a> began with "<a href="/w/index.php?title=On_Top_of_Old_Smoky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="On Top of Old Smoky (page does not exist)">On Top of Old Smoky</a>" and an arrangement of <a href="/wiki/Lead_Belly" title="Lead Belly">Lead Belly</a>'s signature waltz, "<a href="/wiki/Goodnight,_Irene" title="Goodnight, Irene">Goodnight, Irene</a>,"<sup id="cite_ref-pc1_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pc1-4">[4]</a></sup> which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> and was covered by many other pop singers.

</p><p>The Weavers' performing career was abruptly derailed in 1953 at the peak of their popularity when blacklisting prompted radio stations to refuse to play their records and all their bookings were canceled. They briefly returned to the stage, however, at a sold-out reunion at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and in a subsequent <a href="/w/index.php?title=Reunion_tour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Reunion tour (page does not exist)">reunion tour</a>, which produced a hit version of <a href="/wiki/Merle_Travis" title="Merle Travis">Merle Travis</a>'s "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Sixteen_Tons&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sixteen Tons (page does not exist)">Sixteen Tons</a>" as well as LPs of their concert performances. "<a href="/wiki/Kumbaya" title="Kumbaya">Kumbaya</a>," a <a href="/wiki/Gullah" title="Gullah">Gullah</a> black spiritual dating from slavery days, was also introduced to wide audiences by Pete Seeger and the Weavers (in 1959), becoming a staple of Boy and Girl Scout campfires.
</p><p>In the late 1950s, <a href="/wiki/The_Kingston_Trio" title="The Kingston Trio">the Kingston Trio</a> was formed in direct imitation of (and homage to) the Weavers, covering much of the latter's repertoire, though with a more buttoned-down, uncontroversial, and mainstream collegiate persona.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Banjo_and_12-string_guitar">Banjo and 12-string guitar</span></h3>
<p>In 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic <i>How to Play the Five-String Banjo</i>, a book that many <a href="/wiki/Banjo" title="Banjo">banjo</a> players credit with starting them off on the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Musical_instrument&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Musical instrument (page does not exist)">instrument</a>. He went on to invent the <i>Long Neck</i> or <i>Seeger</i> banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, is slightly longer than a <a href="/wiki/Bass_guitar" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a> at 25 frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo. Hitherto strictly limited to the Appalachian region, the five-string banjo became known nationwide as the American folk instrument par excellence, largely thanks to Seeger's championing of and improvements to it. According to an unnamed musician quoted in <a href="/w/index.php?title=David_King_Dunaway&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="David King Dunaway (page does not exist)">David King Dunaway</a>'s biography, "by nesting a resonant chord between two precise notes, a melody note and a chiming note on the fifth string", Pete Seeger "gentrified" the more percussive traditional <a href="/wiki/Appalachia" title="Appalachia">Appalachian</a> "frailing" style, "with its vigorous hammering of the forearm and its percussive rapping of the fingernail on the banjo head."<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Although what Dunaway's informant describes is the age-old droned frailing style, the implication is that Seeger made this more acceptable to mass audiences by omitting some of its percussive complexities, while presumably still preserving the characteristic driving rhythmic quality associated with the style.
</p><p>From the late 1950s on, Seeger also accompanied himself on the <a href="/wiki/12-string_guitar" title="12-string guitar" class="mw-redirect">12-string guitar</a>, an instrument of Mexican origin that had been associated with <a href="/wiki/Lead_Belly" title="Lead Belly">Lead Belly</a>, who had styled himself "the King of the 12-String Guitar". Seeger's distinctive custom-made guitars had a triangular soundhole. He combined the long scale length (approximately 28") and <a href="/wiki/Capo" title="Capo">capo-to-key</a> techniques that he favored on the banjo with a variant of <a href="/wiki/Drop_D_tuning" title="Drop D tuning">drop-D (DADGBE) tuning</a>, tuned two whole steps down with very heavy strings, which he played with thumb and finger picks.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>
