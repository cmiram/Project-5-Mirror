</p><p><b>Edinburgh Castle</b> is a historic <a href="/wiki/Fortress" title="Fortress" class="mw-redirect">fortress</a> which dominates the skyline of the city of <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> from its position on the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Castle_Rock,_Edinburgh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Castle Rock, Edinburgh (page does not exist)">Castle Rock</a>. Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of <a href="/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland" title="David I of Scotland">David I</a> in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns" title="Union of the Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a> in 1603. From the 15th century the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half. As one of the most important strongholds in the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Scotland&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kingdom of Scotland (page does not exist)">Kingdom of Scotland</a>, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the <a href="/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence" title="Wars of Scottish Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> in the 14th century to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jacobite_Rising&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jacobite Rising (page does not exist)">Jacobite Rising</a> of 1745. It has been besieged, both successfully and unsuccessfully, on several occasions.
</p><p>Few of the present buildings pre-date the Lang Siege of the 16th century, when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment. The most notable exceptions are <a href="/w/index.php?title=St_Margaret%27s_Chapel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="St Margaret's Chapel (page does not exist)">St Margaret's Chapel</a> from the early 12th century, which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh,<sup id="cite_ref-eotca_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-eotca-1">[1]</a></sup> the Royal Palace and the early-16th-century Great Hall, although the interiors have been much altered from the mid-<a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> period onwards. The castle also houses the Scottish <a href="/wiki/Regalia" title="Regalia">regalia</a>, known as the <a href="/wiki/Honours_of_Scotland" title="Honours of Scotland">Honours of Scotland</a> and is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the <a href="/w/index.php?title=National_War_Museum_of_Scotland&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="National War Museum of Scotland (page does not exist)">National War Museum of Scotland</a>. The <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a> is still responsible for some parts of the castle, although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative. Some of the castle buildings house <a href="/w/index.php?title=Regimental_museum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Regimental museum (page does not exist)">regimental museums</a> which contribute to its presentation as a tourist attraction.
</p><p>The castle is in the care of <a href="/wiki/Historic_Scotland" title="Historic Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> and is Scotland's most-visited paid tourist attraction, with over 1.2 million visitors in 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-ALVA_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ALVA-2">[2]</a></sup> As the backdrop to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Edinburgh_Military_Tattoo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Edinburgh Military Tattoo (page does not exist)">Edinburgh Military Tattoo</a> during the annual <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_International_Festival" title="Edinburgh International Festival">Edinburgh International Festival</a> the castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh and of Scotland.

<p>The castle stands upon the <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_plug" title="Volcanic plug">plug</a> of an <a href="/w/index.php?title=Extinct_volcano&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Extinct volcano (page does not exist)">extinct volcano</a>, which is estimated to have risen some 350 million years ago during the lower <a href="/wiki/Carboniferous" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> period.

</p><p>The archaeological evidence is more reliable in respect of the Iron Age.

</p><p>The 1990s dig revealed clear signs of habitation from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, consistent with <a href="/wiki/Ptolemy" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s reference to "Alauna". Signs of occupation included some <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Roman</a> material, including pottery, bronzes and brooches, implying a possible trading relationship between the Votadini and the Romans beginning with <a href="/wiki/Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola" title="Gnaeus Julius Agricola">Agricola's</a> northern campaign in AD 82, and continuing through to the establishment of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Antonine_Wall&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Antonine Wall (page does not exist)">Antonine Wall</a> around AD 140.
