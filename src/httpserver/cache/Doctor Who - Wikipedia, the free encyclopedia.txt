On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned <a href="/wiki/Terry_Nation" title="Terry Nation">Terry Nation</a> to write a story under the title <i>The Mutants</i>. As originally written, the <a href="/wiki/Dalek" title="Dalek">Daleks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thal_(Doctor_Who)" title="Thal (Doctor Who)">Thals</a> were the victims of an alien <a href="/wiki/Neutron_bomb" title="Neutron bomb">neutron bomb</a> attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any "<a href="/wiki/Bug-eyed_monster" title="Bug-eyed monster">bug-eyed monsters</a>". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, however, <i>The Mutants</i> was the only script ready to go so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; "We didn't have a lot of choice&#160;— we only had the Dalek serial to go&#160;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that." Nation's script became the second <i>Doctor Who</i> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials" title="List of Doctor Who serials">serial</a>&#160;– <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daleks" title="The Daleks">The Daleks</a></i> (aka <i>The Mutants</i>).

<p>The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme's early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable <a href="/w/index.php?title=Time_machine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Time machine (page does not exist)">time machine</a>, the "<a href="/wiki/TARDIS" title="TARDIS">TARDIS</a>" (an <a href="/wiki/Acronym" title="Acronym">acronym</a> for Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality referred to as "dimensional transcendentality").<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[note 4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[79]</a></sup>
</p><p>The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure.

<p>Producers introduced the concept of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Regeneration_(Doctor_Who)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Regeneration (Doctor Who) (page does not exist)">regeneration</a> to permit the recasting of the main character. This was first prompted by original star <a href="/wiki/William_Hartnell" title="William Hartnell">William Hartnell</a>'s poor health. The actual term "regeneration" was not initially conceived of until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration however; Hartnell's Doctor had merely described undergoing a "renewal," and the Second Doctor underwent a "change of appearance." The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.

This line has stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[81]</a></sup> The episode "<a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Time_of_the_Doctor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Time of the Doctor (page does not exist)">The Time of the Doctor</a>" depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Twelfth_Doctor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Twelfth Doctor (page does not exist)">Twelfth Doctor</a>, due to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Eleventh_Doctor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Eleventh Doctor (page does not exist)">Eleventh Doctor</a> being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set.

</p><p>Throughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Brain_of_Morbius" title="The Brain of Morbius">The Brain of Morbius</a></i> (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor may not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In <i><a href="/wiki/Mawdryn_Undead" title="Mawdryn Undead">Mawdryn Undead</a></i> (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special "<a href="/wiki/The_Five_Doctors" title="The Five Doctors">The Five Doctors</a>", the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms "Fourth!", the First Doctor excitedly replies "Goodness me!

</p><p>During the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord.

The perennial companion figure has been a constant feature in <i>Doctor Who</i> since the programme's inception in 1963. Generally human, one of the roles of the companion is to remind the Doctor of his "moral duty".<sup id="cite_ref-Overview_99-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Overview-99">[94]</a></sup> The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter <a href="/wiki/Susan_Foreman" title="Susan Foreman">Susan Foreman</a> (<a href="/wiki/Carole_Ann_Ford" title="Carole Ann Ford">Carole Ann Ford</a>) and her teachers <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Wright_(Doctor_Who)" title="Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)">Barbara Wright</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Hill" title="Jacqueline Hill">Jacqueline Hill</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Ian_Chesterton" title="Ian Chesterton">Ian Chesterton</a> (<a href="/wiki/William_Russell_(actor)" title="William Russell (actor)">William Russell</a>).

Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&#160;— or loves&#160;— on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.
</p><p>Since the 2005 revival, The Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.

Discusses the revival of the BBC's Doctor Who in 2005 after it had been off the air as a regular series for more than 15 years; topics include the role of "fandom" in the sci-fi programme's return, and notions of "cult" and "mainstream" in television.
