Lincoln led the United States through its <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>--its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional and political crisis.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> In so doing he preserved the <a href="/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a>, abolished slavery, strengthened the national government and modernized the economy. 
</p><p>Reared in a poor family on the <a href="/wiki/American_frontier" title="American frontier">western frontier</a>, Lincoln was a self-educated lawyer in <a href="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)" title="Whig Party (United States)">Whig Party leader</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois_House_of_Representatives" title="Illinois House of Representatives">state legislator</a> during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the Congress during the 1840s.  He promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, canals, railroads and tariffs to encourage the building of factories; he opposed the war with Mexico in 1846.  After a <a href="/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas_debates" title="Lincoln–Douglas debates">series of highly publicized debates</a> in 1858 during which he opposed the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost the U.S. Senate race to his archrival, Democrat <a href="/w/index.php?title=Stephen_A._Douglas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stephen A. Douglas (page does not exist)">Stephen A. Douglas</a>. Lincoln, a moderate from a <a href="/wiki/Swing_state" title="Swing state">swing state</a>, secured the <a href="/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Republican_Party_(United_States)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="History of the Republican Party (United States) (page does not exist)">Republican Party</a> presidential nomination in 1860. With almost no support in the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">South</a>, Lincoln swept the <a href="/wiki/Northern_United_States" title="Northern United States">North</a> and was <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860" title="United States presidential election, 1860">elected president in 1860</a>. His election prompted seven southern slave states to form the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>. No compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery.
</p><p>When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on <a href="/wiki/Fort_Sumter" title="Fort Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His goal was to reunite the nation.  He suspended habeas corpus, arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists in the border states without trial. Lincoln averted British intervention by defusing the Trent affair in late 1861. His numerous complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the <a href="/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> in 1863, using the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>, which permanently outlawed slavery. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general <a href="/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. He made the major decisions on Union war strategy,  Lincoln's Navy set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, helped take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and gained control of the Southern river system using gunboats. He tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.
</p><p>An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to "<a href="/w/index.php?title=War_Democrats&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="War Democrats (page does not exist)">War Democrats</a>" (who supported the North against the South), and managed his own re-election in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1864" title="United States presidential election, 1864">1864 presidential election</a>. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, confronted Radical Republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats who called for more compromise, Copperheads who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his death. Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> His <a href="/wiki/Gettysburg_Address" title="Gettysburg Address">Gettysburg Address</a> of 1863 became an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Lincoln held a moderate view of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Reconstruction Era of the United States (page does not exist)">Reconstruction</a>, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, Lincoln was assassinated by <a href="/wiki/John_Wilkes_Booth" title="John Wilkes Booth">a confederate sympathizer</a>.

<p>The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Anderson_(Civil_War)" title="Robert Anderson (Civil War)">Major Robert Anderson</a>, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war.

Historian <a href="/wiki/Allan_Nevins" title="Allan Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.<sup id="cite_ref-143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman" title="William Tecumseh Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war.<sup id="cite_ref-144" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-144">[144]</a></sup> Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft.

</p><p>On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states.

</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1862" title="United States House of Representatives elections, 1862">mid-term elections</a> in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of <i>habeas corpus,</i> <a href="/wiki/Conscription" title="Conscription">the military draft law</a>, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati <i>Gazette</i> contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".<sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.<sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup>

<p>Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept <a href="/w/index.php?title=Compensated_emancipation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Compensated emancipation (page does not exist)">compensated emancipation</a> in return for their prohibition of slavery.

</p><p>On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second <a href="/w/index.php?title=Confiscation_Acts&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Confiscation Acts (page does not exist)">Confiscation Act</a> was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free".<sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup>
</p><p>Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated.

The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was preserving the Union:<sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.

</blockquote>
<p>The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.<sup id="cite_ref-184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup> Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.<sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup>
</p><p>Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed.

</p><p>In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth".

<p>Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed.

</p><p>Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army.

</p><p>Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting.

Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy."<sup id="cite_ref-218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup> In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. <a href="/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens" title="Thaddeus Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, Sen. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sumner" title="Charles Sumner">Charles Sumner</a> and Sen. <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Wade" title="Benjamin Wade">Benjamin Wade</a>, political allies of the president on other issues.

<p>As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Johnson" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Steele&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Frederick Steele (page does not exist)">Frederick Steele</a> as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General <a href="/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Banks" title="Nathaniel P. Banks">Nathaniel P. Banks</a> to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wade-Davis_Bill&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wade-Davis Bill (page does not exist)">Wade-Davis Bill</a>, in 1864.

</p><p>Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness.

</p><p>After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter".<sup id="cite_ref-222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-222">[222]</a></sup> By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.<sup id="cite_ref-223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-223">[223]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup> Upon ratification, it became the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a> to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.<sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup>

The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction.

<p>The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency.

</p><p>Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life". During the Great Depression, he argues,  Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?"<sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup> However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness".<sup id="cite_ref-298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-298">[298]</a></sup>  He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.
