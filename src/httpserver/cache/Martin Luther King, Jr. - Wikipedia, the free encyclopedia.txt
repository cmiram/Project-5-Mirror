</p><p>King's admiration of Gandhi's non-violence did not diminish in later years, he went so far as to hold up his example when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, hailing the "successful precedent" of using non-violence "in a magnificent way by Mohandas K.

<p>As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: "I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either."<sup id="cite_ref-Oates1993_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oates1993-28">[28]</a></sup>
In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, "I don't think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party.

King critiqued both parties' performance on promoting racial equality: <blockquote class="templatequote">Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern Republicans.

<p>Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he was undecided as to whether he would vote for <a href="/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson_II" title="Adlai Stevenson II">Adlai Stevenson</a> or <a href="/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower" title="Dwight Eisenhower" class="mw-redirect">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, but that "In the past I always voted the Democratic ticket."<sup id="cite_ref-King-Carson1992p384_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-King-Carson1992p384-31">[31]</a></sup>

The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in <a href="/wiki/Albany,_Georgia" title="Albany, Georgia">Albany, Georgia</a> in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a broad-front nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation within the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he "had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel."<sup id="cite_ref-Hatchette_55-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hatchette-55">[55]</a></sup>
The following day he was swept up in a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mass_arrest&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mass arrest (page does not exist)">mass arrest</a> of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions.

</p><p>King returned in July 1962, and was sentenced to forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine. He chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. "We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools&#160;... ejected from churches&#160;... and thrown into jail&#160;...

</p><p>After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate.

<p>In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama" title="Birmingham, Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>.

<p>The march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital.

In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the "Poor People's Campaign" to address issues of economic justice.
