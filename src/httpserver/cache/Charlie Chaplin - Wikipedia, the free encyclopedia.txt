</p><p><b>Sir Charles Spencer</b> "<b>Charlie</b>" <b>Chaplin</b>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Post-nominals&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Post-nominals (page does not exist)">Template:Post-nominals</a> (16&#160;April 1889&#160;– 25&#160;December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the <a href="/wiki/Silent_film" title="Silent film">silent era</a>. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona "<a href="/wiki/The_Tramp" title="The Tramp">the Tramp</a>" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry.<sup id="cite_ref-acclaim_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-acclaim-1">[1]</a></sup> His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> until a year before his death at age 88, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.
</p><p>Chaplin's childhood in London was defined by poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a <a href="/wiki/Workhouse" title="Workhouse">workhouse</a> twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring <a href="/wiki/Music_hall" title="Music hall">music halls</a> and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19 he was signed to the prestigious <a href="/wiki/Fred_Karno" title="Fred Karno">Fred Karno</a> company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry, and made his first appearance in <a href="/wiki/Keystone_Studios" title="Keystone Studios">Keystone Studios</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Making_a_Living" title="Making a Living">Making a Living</a></i> (1914). He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his films from an early stage, and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the <a href="/wiki/Essanay" title="Essanay" class="mw-redirect">Essanay</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mutual_Film&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mutual Film (page does not exist)">Mutual</a>, and <a href="/wiki/First_National" title="First National">First National</a> corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best known figures in the world.
</p><p>In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company <a href="/wiki/United_Artists" title="United Artists">United Artists</a>, which gave him complete control over his films. His first <a href="/w/index.php?title=Feature-length&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Feature-length (page does not exist)">feature-length</a> was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Kid_(1921_film)" title="The Kid (1921 film)">The Kid</a></i> (1921), followed by <i><a href="/wiki/A_Woman_of_Paris" title="A Woman of Paris">A Woman of Paris</a></i> (1923), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gold_Rush" title="The Gold Rush">The Gold Rush</a></i> (1925), and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Circus_(film)" title="The Circus (film)">The Circus</a></i> (1928). He refused to move to <a href="/wiki/Sound_film" title="Sound film">sound films</a> in the 1930s, instead producing <i><a href="/wiki/City_Lights" title="City Lights">City Lights</a></i> (1931) and <i><a href="/wiki/Modern_Times_(film)" title="Modern Times (film)">Modern Times</a></i> (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political and his next film, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Great_Dictator" title="The Great Dictator">The Great Dictator</a></i> (1940), satirised <a href="/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Adolf Hitler (page does not exist)">Adolf Hitler</a>. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of <a href="/wiki/Communist" title="Communist" class="mw-redirect">communist</a> sympathies, while his involvement in a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Paternity_suit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Paternity suit (page does not exist)">paternity suit</a> and marriages to much younger women caused  scandal. An <a href="/wiki/FBI" title="FBI" class="mw-redirect">FBI</a> investigation was opened, and Chaplin was  forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include <i><a href="/wiki/Monsieur_Verdoux" title="Monsieur Verdoux">Monsieur Verdoux</a></i> (1947), <i><a href="/wiki/Limelight_(1952_film)" title="Limelight (1952 film)">Limelight</a></i> (1952), <i><a href="/wiki/A_King_in_New_York" title="A King in New York">A King in New York</a></i> (1957), and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=A_Countess_from_Hong_Kong&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="A Countess from Hong Kong (page does not exist)">A Countess from Hong Kong</a></i> (1967).
</p><p>Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by <a href="/wiki/Slapstick" title="Slapstick">slapstick</a> combined with <a href="/wiki/Pathos" title="Pathos">pathos</a>, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award" title="Academy Honorary Award">Honorary Academy Award</a> for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century". He continues to be held in high regard, with <i>The Gold Rush</i>, <i>City Lights</i>, <i>Modern Times</i>, and <i>The Great Dictator</i> often ranked among industry lists of the greatest films of all time.
