</p><p>As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

<p>Through 1969, the Beatles' catalogue was published almost exclusively by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Northern_Songs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Northern Songs (page does not exist)">Northern Songs Ltd.</a>, a company formed in February 1963 by music publisher <a href="/wiki/Dick_James" title="Dick James">Dick James</a> specifically for Lennon and McCartney, though it later acquired songs by other artists. The company was organized with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion—19 or 20%—and Brian Epstein's—9 or 10%—which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.<a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sfn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sfn (page does not exist)">Template:Sfn</a><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sfn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sfn (page does not exist)">Template:Sfn</a><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sfn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sfn (page does not exist)">Template:Sfn</a>
</p><p>In 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75 million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5 million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company NEMS Enterprises received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25 million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000.<a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sfn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sfn (page does not exist)">Template:Sfn</a> At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.<a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sfn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sfn (page does not exist)">Template:Sfn</a>

Soon after, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for £20 million, giving the ex-Beatle "a week or so" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a £5 million bid that was rejected.<a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Sfn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Sfn (page does not exist)">Template:Sfn</a> According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs, and turned down an offer of £21–£25 million from McCartney and Ono for ATV Music.
