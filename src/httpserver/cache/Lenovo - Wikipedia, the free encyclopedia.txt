The Chinese name (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Zh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Zh (page does not exist)">Template:Zh</a>) means "association" (as in "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Word_association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Word association (page does not exist)">word association</a>") or "connected thinking" but can also imply <a href="/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-cam_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cam-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>For the first 20 years of its existence, the company's English name was "Legend" (in Chinese 联想 <i>Lianxiang</i>).

In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new name, "Lenovo", with a large media campaign involving huge outdoor billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards featured the Lenovo logo against blue sky with copy that read, "Transcendence depends on how you think." By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on <a href="/wiki/Rebranding" title="Rebranding">rebranding</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Book1_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Book1-5">[5]</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Founding_and_early_history">Founding and early history</span></h3>
<p>Liu founded Lenovo in 1984 with a group of ten engineers in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Beijing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Beijing (page does not exist)">Beijing</a> with 200,000 <a href="/wiki/Renminbi" title="Renminbi">yuan</a>. Lenovo officially states that it was founded on 1 November 1984. Lenovo's incorporation was approved by the Chinese government on the same day. Jia Xufu, one of the founders of Lenovo, indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October of the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders were middle-aged members of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Institute_of_Computing_Technology,_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (page does not exist)">Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Zeng_Maochao&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zeng Maochao (page does not exist)">Zeng Maochao</a>. The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.<sup id="cite_ref-Book1_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Book1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Their first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process <a href="/wiki/Chinese_characters" title="Chinese characters">Chinese characters</a>. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, "Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product." Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. "We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market", Liu said. "We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous", said Liu. In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.<sup id="cite_ref-chief_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chief-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>In May 1988, Lenovo placed its first advertisement seeking employees. The ad was placed on the front page of the <i>China Youth News</i>. Such ads were quite rare in China at this time. Out of 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. These new hires included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yang_Yuanqing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yang Yuanqing (page does not exist)">Yang Yuanqing</a> was among this group.<sup id="cite_ref-Book1_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Book1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="/w/index.php?title=Liu_Chuanzhi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Liu Chuanzhi (page does not exist)">Liu Chuanzhi</a>, received government permission to open a subsidiary in Hong Kong and was allowed to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. In order to save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. In order to keep up appearances they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<sup id="cite_ref-Book1_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Book1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="IPO_and_secondary_offerings">IPO and secondary offerings</span></h3>
<p>Lenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital.
</p><p>When Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a "roadshow" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, "Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company."<sup id="cite_ref-Book1_5-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Book1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>In order to get capital to fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued another secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.<sup id="cite_ref-Book1_5-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Book1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Mary Ma, Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in Mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on CCTV. Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.<sup id="cite_ref-Book1_5-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Book1-5">[5]</a></sup>

Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development. He stated, "If you look at the industry trends, most innovations for" PCs, smartphones, tablets and smart TVs are related to innovation of key components—display, battery and storage.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Corporate_culture">Corporate culture</span></h3>
<p>Lenovo's corporate culture differs significantly from most large Chinese companies. While Lenovo was founded using seed capital from the state-owned <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Chinese Academy of Sciences">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, Lenovo is run as a private enterprise with little or no interference by the state. Lenovo's senior executives, including many non-Chinese, rotate between two head offices, one in Beijing and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lenovo's research and development center in Japan. Two Westerners have served as Lenovo's CEO.<sup id="cite_ref-Econ1_43-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Econ1-43">[43]</a></sup>
</p><p>English is Lenovo's official language. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville in order to improve his language skills and soak up American culture. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by <i>The Economist</i> praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a "performance culture" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of "waiting to see what the emperor wants."<sup id="cite_ref-Econ1_43-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Econ1-43">[43]</a></sup>
</p><p>When Yang took over Lenovo's personal computer division, he strongly discouraged the use of formal titles and required staff to address each other by their given names. Yang even required managers to stand outside their offices each morning to greet their employees while carrying signs with their first names. When Yang's division moved to a new building in 1997, he used the move to break Lenovo's cultural links to the past by insisting on a more formal dress code and training all employees in telephone etiquette; Yang wanted his people to think and act like high-tech workers in developed markets.

Ward, Jr.</a> Ward was succeeded by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bill_Amelio&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bill Amelio (page does not exist)">Bill Amelio</a> on December 20, 2005. On February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO. 
</p><p>In 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in-turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, “redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.” Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, "felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.”<sup id="cite_ref-Bonus_85-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bonus-85">[85]</a></sup> The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314. This was almost equivalent to a monthly salary of an average worker in China.<sup id="cite_ref-WPBlog_86-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WPBlog-86">[86]</a></sup> Yang made a similar gift of $3.25 million again in 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-Huff_87-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Huff-87">[87]</a></sup>
</p><p>According to Lenovo's annual report, Yang earned $14 million, including $5.2 million in bonuses, during the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-CNNBonus_88-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CNNBonus-88">[88]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 2013, <i>Barron's</i> named Yang one of the "World's Best CEOs." <sup id="cite_ref-Best_89-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Best-89">[89]</a></sup>

<p>In early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Yang_(entrepreneur)" title="Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)">Jerry Yang</a> to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, ""Jerry’s appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo’s reputation as a transparent international company."

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emerging_markets">Emerging markets</span></h3>
<p>In 2009 Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets, such as China, India, and Brazil, and mature markets, such as the United States, Japan, and Europe. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. This approach has now been widely adopted among Lenovo's competitors.<sup id="cite_ref-People_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-People-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-Econ1_43-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Econ1-43">[43]</a></sup>

<p>In China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.<sup id="cite_ref-Econ1_43-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Econ1-43">[43]</a></sup>
</p><p>As of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier <a href="/wiki/Li_Keqiang" title="Li Keqiang">Li Keqiang</a> will allow it to sustain sales growth in mainland China for the foreseeable future. Speaking of Lenovo’s prospects on the mainland at its annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: “I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.”  Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government’s rural subsidy, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program of subsidies, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.<sup id="cite_ref-FT2_91-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FT2-91">[91]</a></sup>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="India">India</span></h4>
<p>Lenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as <a href="/wiki/Ingram_Micro" title="Ingram Micro">Ingram Micro</a> and Redington.<sup id="cite_ref-India6_92-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-India6-92">[92]</a></sup>
</p><p>Given that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, "To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our regional distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area." <sup id="cite_ref-India6_92-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-India6-92">[92]</a></sup> As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under-penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.<sup id="cite_ref-India6_92-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-India6-92">[92]</a></sup>
</p><p>In India, where Lenovo is relatively unknown, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories, but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain market intelligence and speed up product development.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Africa">Africa</span></h4>
<p>Lenovo plans to release its smartphones in Nigeria in the second half of 2013 in an effort to find markets where it can sell directly to consumers. Lenovo specifically picked Nigeria, because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones. Nigeria is Africa's second-largest economy after South Africa. Lenovo will sell its phones across as many as six price segments with the most expensive selling for about US$500. Lenovo says it is investigating the rest of Africa and that Egypt will be its next target for expansion.<sup id="cite_ref-Africa1_93-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Africa1-93">[93]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>
<p>In the United States, Lenovo began the "For Those Who Do" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency <a href="/wiki/Saatchi_%26_Saatchi" title="Saatchi &amp; Saatchi">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</a>. The campaign was Lenovo's first to go global, with the exception of its domestic market in China, where it retained its existing "Imagine" (lian xiang) slogan. The campaign did not reach China because "do" carries connotations of physical work in the country, an image that Lenovo did not want attached to their brand.<sup id="cite_ref-fc_94-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-fc-94">[94]</a></sup> "For Those Who Do" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18-to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as "doers".<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>
