<p>NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXIV to New Orleans, Louisiana during their March 10–15, 1985 meetings.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="San_Francisco_49ers">San Francisco 49ers</span></h3>
<p>The 49ers entered the game seeking to win their second straight Super Bowl. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bill_Walsh_(football_coach)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bill Walsh (football coach) (page does not exist)">Bill Walsh</a> retired as head coach after San Francisco's 20–16 win over the <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> in the previous year's <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXIII" title="Super Bowl XXIII">Super Bowl XXIII</a> but rookie head coach <a href="/wiki/George_Seifert" title="George Seifert">George Seifert</a> did not miss a beat as he guided the 49ers to a league best 14–2 regular season record.  Their 2 losses were only by a combined margin of 5 points.
</p><p>The 49ers offense was just as dominating as it was during the previous regular season. Quarterback <a href="/wiki/Joe_Montana" title="Joe Montana">Joe Montana</a> threw for 3,512 yards, 26 touchdowns, and only 8 interceptions, giving him what was then the highest  season single <a href="/wiki/Passer_rating" title="Passer rating">quarterback rating</a> in NFL history (112.4). Montana also rushed for 227 yards and 3 touchdowns, and earned both the <a href="/w/index.php?title=NFL_Most_Valuable_Player_Award&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="NFL Most Valuable Player Award (page does not exist)">NFL Most Valuable Player Award</a> and the <a href="/w/index.php?title=NFL_Offensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award (page does not exist)">NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award</a>. Wide receiver <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Rice" title="Jerry Rice">Jerry Rice</a> had another outstanding season, catching 82 passes for 1,483 yards and 17 touchdowns.  Running back <a href="/wiki/Roger_Craig_(American_football)" title="Roger Craig (American football)">Roger Craig</a> was the team's leading rusher with 1,054 yards and 6 touchdowns, and he recorded 49 receptions for 473 yards and another touchdown.
</p><p>But other stars on the 49ers offense began to emerge, enabling the team to spread the ball around. After being used primarily as a punt returner during his first 2 seasons, wide receiver <a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Taylor_(American_football_player)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John Taylor (American football player) (page does not exist)">John Taylor</a> had a breakout season, catching 60 passes for 1,077 yards and 10 touchdowns, while also returning 36 punts for 417 yards.  Tight End <a href="/wiki/Brent_Jones" title="Brent Jones">Brent Jones</a> recorded 40 receptions for 500 yards.  Fullback <a href="/wiki/Tom_Rathman" title="Tom Rathman">Tom Rathman</a> had the best season of his career, rushing for 305 yards and catching 73 passes for 616 yards.  Kicker <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mike_Cofer_(kicker)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mike Cofer (kicker) (page does not exist)">Mike Cofer</a> scored 136 points while making a career high 80.6% of his field goals. Even Montana's backup, quarterback <a href="/w/index.php?title=Steve_Young_(American_football)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Steve Young (American football) (page does not exist)">Steve Young</a>, had a great year, throwing for 1,001 yards and 8 touchdowns with only 3 interceptions, while also rushing for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns. With all of these weapons, San Francisco's offense led the league in total yards from scrimmage (6,268) and scoring (442 points).
</p><p>The 49ers defense ranked third in the NFL in fewest points allowed (253).  Defensive end <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pierce_Holt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pierce Holt (page does not exist)">Pierce Holt</a> recorded 10.5 sacks, as did linebacker <a href="/wiki/Charles_Haley" title="Charles Haley">Charles Haley</a>.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Denver_Broncos">Denver Broncos</span></h3>
<p>The Broncos were trying to avoid becoming the second team, after the Vikings, to lose a fourth Super Bowl. After appearing in <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXI" title="Super Bowl XXI">Super Bowl XXI</a> and <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXII" title="Super Bowl XXII">Super Bowl XXII</a>, the team missed the playoffs with an 8–8 record during the previous season. But they signed several new players in the off-season to help them win 10 of their first 12 games and finish with an 11–5 record.
</p><p>One of Denver's new major additions was rookie running back <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Humphrey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bobby Humphrey (page does not exist)">Bobby Humphrey</a>, who rushed for 1,151 yards, caught 22 passes for 156 yards, and scored 8 touchdowns. Humphrey gave the Broncos a powerful running attack that they lacked in their previous Super Bowl seasons.  Also new to the team was rookie kicker <a href="/w/index.php?title=David_Treadwell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="David Treadwell (page does not exist)">David Treadwell</a>, who made the pro bowl with an 81.8% field goal percentage and ranked third in the NFL with 120 points. The defense had a new weapon as well: rookie free safety <a href="/wiki/Steve_Atwater" title="Steve Atwater">Steve Atwater</a>. Together with veteran defensive backs <a href="/w/index.php?title=Dennis_Smith_(American_football)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dennis Smith (American football) (page does not exist)">Dennis Smith</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wymon_Henderson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wymon Henderson (page does not exist)">Wymon Henderson</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Tyrone_Braxton&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tyrone Braxton (page does not exist)">Tyrone Braxton</a>, the Broncos secondary combined for 14 interceptions.  Braxton lead the team with 6, which he returned for 103 yards and a touchdown, while also recovering 2 fumbles.  Another new addition was defensive end <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ron_Holmes&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ron Holmes (page does not exist)">Ron Holmes</a>, who recorded 9 sacks.  Holmes, along with veteran linebackers <a href="/wiki/Karl_Mecklenburg" title="Karl Mecklenburg">Karl Mecklenburg</a> (7.5 sacks and 4 fumble recoveries) and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Simon_Fletcher_(American_football)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Simon Fletcher (American football) (page does not exist)">Simon Fletcher</a> (12 sacks) gave Denver one of the top defensive lines in the AFC.
</p><p>Veteran receiver <a href="/w/index.php?title=Vance_Johnson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vance Johnson (page does not exist)">Vance Johnson</a> had the best season of his career, catching 76 passes for 1,095 yards and 7 touchdowns, while also returning 12 punts for 118 yards. However, quarterback <a href="/wiki/John_Elway" title="John Elway">John Elway</a> played inconsistently during the regular season, throwing just as many interceptions as touchdowns (18) and recording only a 73.7 passer rating.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Playoffs">Playoffs</span></h3>
<p><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Rellink&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Rellink (page does not exist)">Template:Rellink</a>
</p><p>Despite his regular season problems, Elway ended up playing his best during the playoffs. First, he led the Broncos on a last minute touchdown drive to narrowly defeat the <a href="/w/index.php?title=1989_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="1989 Pittsburgh Steelers season (page does not exist)">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, 24–23. The Steelers held a 17–10 halftime lead before Elway's 37-yard touchdown pass to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Vance_Johnson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vance Johnson (page does not exist)">Vance Johnson</a> tied the game in the third quarter. Then after Pittsburgh scored 2 field goals to take a 23–17 fourth quarter lead, Elway led the Broncos on a 71-yard drive to score on the Melvin Bratton's 1-yard game winning touchdown run. On the ensuing drive, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Randy_Robbins_(American_football)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Randy Robbins (American football) (page does not exist)">Randy Robbins</a> then recovered a Steelers fumble on third down with 2:02 left to clinch the victory.
</p><p>The Broncos then defeated the <a href="/w/index.php?title=1989_Cleveland_Browns_season&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="1989 Cleveland Browns season (page does not exist)">Cleveland Browns</a>, 37–21, in the AFC Championship Game. This was the third time in the last four years that both teams faced each other for the AFC Championship, and the previous two resulted in two of the most famous games in <a href="/w/index.php?title=NFL_Lore&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="NFL Lore (page does not exist)">NFL Lore</a>: <a href="/wiki/The_Drive" title="The Drive">The Drive</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Fumble" title="The Fumble">The Fumble</a>. In this game, the Broncos seemed to be in complete control at first, building up a 24–7 lead. But Browns quarterback <a href="/wiki/Bernie_Kosar" title="Bernie Kosar">Bernie Kosar</a> rallied his team back with 2 third-quarter touchdowns, cutting the lead to 24–21 going into the final period. Some observers began to wonder if this game would become known as "The Comeback".  However, Elway destroyed any chance of a Browns comeback by leading the Broncos 80 yards and scoring with a 39-yard touchdown pass to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sammy_Winder&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sammy Winder (page does not exist)">Sammy Winder</a> on the first drive of the fourth quarter. Denver then scored field goals on each of their next 2 drives to put the game away.  Elway finished the game with 385 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions, while also leading Denver in rushing with 5 carries for 39 yards.
</p><p>Meanwhile, San Francisco started out their postseason by blowing out the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>, 41–13.  Minnesota started out the game by marching 70 yards on their opening drive and scoring a field goal to take a 3–0 lead.  But the 49ers dominated the rest of the game.  On their first play from the line of scrimmage, Montana completed a short pass to Rice, who then took it all the way to the end zone for a 72-yard touchdown reception.  The next time they had the ball, Montana led them on another touchdown drive, scoring on a short pass to Jones.  Then defensive back <a href="/w/index.php?title=Chet_Brooks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Chet Brooks (page does not exist)">Chet Brooks</a> intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wade_Wilson_(American_football)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wade Wilson (American football) (page does not exist)">Wade Wilson</a> and returned it 28 yards, setting up Montana's third touchdown pass on an 8-yard toss to Taylor.  Then just before half ended, Montana threw another touchdown pass to Rice, giving the 49ers a 28–3 halftime lead.  Then in the fourth quarter, San Francisco scored 2 more touchdowns to put the game away: a 53-yard interception return by Lott and a 4-yard run by Craig.  Montana finished the game with 241 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Wilson was held to just 9 completions for 74 yards and intercepted twice.
</p><p>The 49ers then entered the NFC Championship Game against the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams" title="Los Angeles Rams" class="mw-redirect">Los Angeles Rams</a>, who had defeated San Francisco in one of their two regular season games against them and were coming off postseason wins against two of the NFC's toughest teams, the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Giants" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>.  The Rams scored first to take a 3–0 lead. However, the 49ers took over in the second quarter, scoring 21 unanswered points on 2 touchdown passes by Montana and touchdown run by Craig.  By the time the first half ended, San Francisco had a commanding 21–3 lead and went on to a surprisingly easy 30–3 win and their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance.  Montana had another superb performance, compiling 262 passing yards and 2 touchdowns, again without throwing an interception. Rams quarterback <a href="/wiki/Jim_Everett" title="Jim Everett">Jim Everett</a> was held to 163 yards and threw 3 interceptions.

<p>Although Elway's performance in the AFC Championship Game was widely considered his best ever, many sports writers and fans believed that the Broncos' best effort would not be good enough to beat the 49ers. After all, Denver had barely defeated the Steelers who only had a 9–7 regular season record, while the 9–6–1 Cleveland Browns had almost overcome a 17-point second half deficit before Denver put them away in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the Elway-led Broncos had already lost two Super Bowls. On the other hand, the Montana-led 49ers with their powerful offense had already won three Super Bowls.
</p><p>Montana came into this game with a 7–0 record as a starting quarterback at the Superdome due to the 49ers' dominance of their then-NFC West rival <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints" title="New Orleans Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>. The 49ers' only loss in the Superdome in the 1980s came in 1986, when <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mike_Moroski&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mike Moroski (page does not exist)">Mike Moroski</a> started for an injured Montana.

<p>The 49ers blew out the Broncos by gaining 461 yards of total offense, holding the ball for 39:31, and scoring on six of their first eight drives. The San Francisco defense also limited the Broncos to 167 yards, 12 first downs, and a time of possession to 20:29.
</p><p>On their opening possession, Denver was forced to punt after three plays and the 49ers scored on their ensuing drive, marching 66 yards and scoring on a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback <a href="/wiki/Joe_Montana" title="Joe Montana">Joe Montana</a> to receiver <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Rice" title="Jerry Rice">Jerry Rice</a>.
</p><p>The Broncos responded with a 49-yard scoring drive, mainly on plays by running back <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Humphrey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bobby Humphrey (page does not exist)">Bobby Humphrey</a>, who rushed 4 times for 22 yards and caught a 27-yard <a href="/w/index.php?title=Shovel_pass&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Shovel pass (page does not exist)">shovel pass</a>, Elway's longest completion of the game.

Once again, the Broncos were forced to punt three plays after the ensuing kickoff, and the 49ers advanced 69 yards in 13 plays to score another touchdown.  The key player on that drive was fullback <a href="/wiki/Tom_Rathman" title="Tom Rathman">Tom Rathman</a>, who caught 3 passes for 39 yards, kept the drive alive with a successful run on a fourth down conversion, and capped it off with a 1-yard  touchdown to make the score 20–3.

</p><p>When the second half started, the 49ers picked up right where they left off. Linebacker Mike Walter intercepted Broncos quarterback <a href="/wiki/John_Elway" title="John Elway">John Elway</a>'s first pass of the third quarter, and Montana threw a 28-yard touchdown reception to Rice on the next play. Then Elway was intercepted again on the Broncos' ensuing drive, this time by Brooks, who returned the ball 38 yards to the Denver 37-yard line. Two plays later, Montana fooled defensive back <a href="/wiki/Steve_Atwater" title="Steve Atwater">Steve Atwater</a> with a pump fake in Rice's direction, and then threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Taylor, making the score 41–3.
</p><p>Denver's lone touchdown came on their next possession, a 61-yard, 5-play drive. First, Broncos defensive back <a href="/w/index.php?title=Darren_Carrington&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Darren Carrington (page does not exist)">Darren Carrington</a> returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards to the 39-yard line.

Elway then capped off the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run on third down, cutting their deficit to 41–10.
</p><p>However, the 49ers continued to dominate the Broncos. San Francisco responded to Denver's score with an 11-play, 75-yard drive that took 6:56 off the clock, and ended with Rathman's 3-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter.  Then after the ensuing kickoff, Elway was sacked for a 6-yard loss by defensive end <a href="/w/index.php?title=Danny_Stubbs&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Danny Stubbs (page does not exist)">Danny Stubbs</a>.

</p><p>Rice finished the game with 7 receptions for 148 yards and a Super Bowl record 3 receiving touchdowns. He joined teammate Roger Craig as the only players to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl. (Craig did it in <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIX" title="Super Bowl XIX">Super Bowl XIX</a> – 2 receiving and 1 rushing.) Craig was the leading rusher of the game with 69 rushing yards and a touchdown, while also catching 5 passes for 34 yards. Rathman rushed for 38 yards and 2 touchdowns while also catching 4 passes for 43 yards. Taylor caught 3 passes for 49 yards and a touchdown and added another 38 yards on 3 punt returns. Elway was held to just 10 completions out of 26 attempts for 108 yards with no touchdowns and was intercepted twice. Elway also ran for a touchdown and fumbled twice (although he recovered one of them). Humphrey was Denver's leading rusher and receiver, with 61 rushing yards and 3 receptions for 38 yards.
