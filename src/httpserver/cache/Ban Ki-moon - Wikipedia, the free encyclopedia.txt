</p><p>As the Secretary-General election drew closer, there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf.

Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were "groundless."

</p><p>In the final informal poll on 2 October, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention ("no opinion") from the fifteen members of the Security Council. The one abstention came from the Japanese delegation, who <a href="/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_disputes" title="Japan–Korea disputes">vehemently opposed</a> the idea of a Korean taking the role of Secretary-General. Due to the overwhelming support of Ban by the rest of the Security Council, Japan later voted in favor of Ban to avoid controversy. More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto; each of the other candidates received at least one "no" vote from among the five permanent members.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>According to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i>, "some U.N. employees and delegates" expressed resentment at Ban's perceived <a href="/wiki/Favoritism" title="Favoritism" class="mw-redirect">favoritism</a> in the appointment of South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous U.N. chiefs such as <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Waldheim" title="Kurt Waldheim">Kurt Waldheim</a> (Austria), <a href="/wiki/Javier_P%C3%A9rez_de_Cu%C3%A9llar" title="Javier Pérez de Cuéllar">Javier Pérez de Cuéllar</a> (Peru) and <a href="/wiki/Boutros_Boutros-Ghali" title="Boutros Boutros-Ghali">Boutros Boutros-Ghali</a> (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry. But according to "some officials" in the <i>Post</i> story, Ban has gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in U.N. ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office. In response, Ban and his aides have claimed that allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racism</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-fav_92-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-fav-92">[92]</a></sup> He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed — including <a href="/w/index.php?title=Choi_Young-jin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Choi Young-jin (page does not exist)">Choi Young-jin</a>, who has served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department — are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea say the complaints are driven by envy, "I think being from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. If he brings along talented people who (whom) he knows very well, I think that's also a plus." U.N. records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top U.N. post.<sup id="cite_ref-fav_92-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-fav-92">[92]</a></sup>
