With that point total, the Patriots became the first team to score at least 500 points in a season four different times, with Brady leading all four squads (another record). He finished the season with 4,827 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, only 8 interceptions, and a passer rating of 98.7. It was Brady's third straight season throwing for over 30 touchdowns.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>

<p>Tom Brady and the New England Patriots began the season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Rob_Gronkowski&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rob Gronkowski (page does not exist)">Rob Gronkowski</a>, the arrest of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Aaron_Hernandez&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Aaron Hernandez (page does not exist)">Aaron Hernandez</a>, the departure of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wes_Welker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wes Welker (page does not exist)">Wes Welker</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Denver_Broncos" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Danny_Woodhead&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Danny Woodhead (page does not exist)">Danny Woodhead</a> to the <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers" title="San Diego Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a> in free agency, and the release of <a href="/wiki/Brandon_Lloyd" title="Brandon Lloyd">Brandon Lloyd</a>.

Despite showing good chemistry with his new receiving corps in the preseason, Brady struggled in the first 2 games of the season completing only 52% of his passes (48 out of 91) and only 3 TD and one interception and passer rating under 75.0 in both games.
In Weeks 3 and 4, Brady completed over 60% of his passes and threw 4 TDs and 1 interception in wins over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons. Brady, who was in pursuit of Drew Brees' record of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Most_consecutive_games_with_a_touchdown_pass_(NFL)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Most consecutive games with a touchdown pass (NFL) (page does not exist)">at least one touchdown in 54 consecutive games</a>, saw the streak end at 52 games in a Week 5 loss against the Cincinnati Bengals that held him to 197 yards, completing under 50% of his passes (18 out of 38) for the second time in the season. In a Week 6 game against the New Orleans Saints, the Patriots struggled in the first half and bounced back in the second with Brady going 25 out of 43, for 269 yards and a clutch touchdown pass to Kenbrell Thompkins as time expired to pull out the upset over the Saints. The Patriots improved to 5–1 on the season. In Week 6 against the New York Jets, Brady was outplayed by Geno Smith, despite Rob Gronkowski coming back and having 8 catches for 114 yards. Brady completed 47.8% of his passes, marking the third time in the season he went under 50%. With Gronkowski healthy again, the Patriots had wins in Week 7 against divisional rival Miami Dolphins and Week 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Brady having his best game of the season going 23 out of 33, for 432 yards 4 TD and 0 interceptions, with a nearly perfect passer rating of 151.8 in a 55–31 win. Brady and the Patriots headed to the bye week with a 7–2 record. In a Week 10 loss to the Carolina Panthers, the Patriots trailed by 4 and Brady, with only 59 second left and three timeouts, drove his offense downfield to Carolina's 18 yard line, and with 3 seconds left, threw a pass to Rob Gronkowski that was intercepted despite the officials calling a defensive pass interference penalty on Luke Kuechly that was waved off. Brady and the 7–3 Patriots began in Week 11 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, in what was the 14th clash between the two, a series of three dramatic comeback wins. After going to the half trailing by 24, Brady and the Patriots scored 31 unanswered points. The Patriots won after a muffed punt in overtime with a field goal from Stephen Gostkowski. Brady outplayed Peyton Manning, who had been playing at an MVP level, throwing for 344 yards and 3 TDs as Peyton threw for 150 with 1 TD and an interception. After that, the Patriots began their Week 13 and Week 14 matchups trailing in the first half to then pull out comebacks in the 4th quarter. In the Week 15 AFC East clash against the Dolphins, the Patriots could have become, at least temporarily, the number 1 seed in the AFC as well as clinched the AFC East title for 5th season in a row, but this time the 4th quarter comeback was denied as Brady threw an interception as time expired on a potential game winning drive. Brady and the Patriots fell to 10–4. With a Week 16 win over the Baltimore Ravens, Brady collected his 147th win as a starting quarterback and tied Dan Marino for 4th place all time. With the Week 17 win over the Buffalo Bills, Tom Brady tied John Elway for the 3rd place all time in wins as a starting quarterback.
