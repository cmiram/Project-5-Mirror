Ultimately, Sinatra did not find the success on television for which he had hoped. The persona he presented to the TV audience was not that of a performer easily welcomed into homes. He projected an arrogance not compatible with the type of cozy congeniality that played well on the small screen.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaplan_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaplan-28">[28]</a></sup><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Rp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Rp (page does not exist)">Template:Rp</a>
</p><p>His last studio recording for Columbia was made in New York <sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> in September 1952, "Why Try To Change Me Now", with orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith. Columbia and MCA dropped him later in 1952.
</p><p>The rebirth of Sinatra's career began with the eve-of-<a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> drama <i><a href="/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity" title="From Here to Eternity">From Here to Eternity</a></i> (1953), for which he won an <a href="/w/index.php?title=Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (page does not exist)">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>. This role and performance marked a turnaround in Sinatra's career: after several years of critical and commercial decline, becoming an Oscar-winning actor helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1953, Sinatra starred in the NBC radio program <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Rocky_Fortune&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rocky Fortune (page does not exist)">Rocky Fortune</a></i>. His character, Rocco Fortunato (aka Rocky Fortune) was a temp worker for the Gridley Employment Agency who stumbled into crime-solving by way of the odd jobs to which he was dispatched. The series <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> aired on NBC radio Tuesday nights from October 1953 to March 1954, following the network's crime drama hit <i><a href="/wiki/Dragnet_(series)" title="Dragnet (series)">Dragnet</a></i>. During the final months of the show, just before the 1954 Oscars, it became a running gag that Sinatra would manage to work the phrase "from here to eternity" into each episode, a reference to his Oscar-nominated performance.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>Also in 1953, Sinatra signed with <a href="/wiki/Capitol_Records" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>, where he worked with many of the finest musical arrangers of the era, most notably <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Riddle" title="Nelson Riddle">Nelson Riddle</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-pc22_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pc22-11">[11]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Jenkins" title="Gordon Jenkins">Gordon Jenkins</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Billy_May" title="Billy May">Billy May</a>. With a series of albums featuring darker emotional material, Sinatra reinvented himself, including <i><a href="/wiki/In_the_Wee_Small_Hours" title="In the Wee Small Hours">In the Wee Small Hours</a></i> (1955)—Sinatra's first 12" LP and his second collaboration with Nelson Riddle—<i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Where_Are_You%3F_(Frank_Sinatra_album)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Where Are You?

He also incorporated a hipper, "swinging" persona into some of his music, as heard on <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Swing_Easy!&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Swing Easy!

</p><p>By the end of the year, Billboard had named "Young at Heart" Song of the Year; <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Swing_Easy!&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Swing Easy!

Cuts from this LP, such as "Angel Eyes" and "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples of Sinatra's concerts throughout his life.
</p><p>Through the late fifties, Sinatra frequently criticized rock and roll music, much of it being his reaction to rhythms and attitudes he found alien. In 1958 he lambasted it as "sung, played, and written for the most part by cretinous goons. It manages to be the martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth."<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

</p><p>The released FBI files reveal some tantalizing insights into Sinatra's lifetime consistency in pursuing and embracing seemingly conflicting affiliations. But Sinatra's alliances had a practical aspect. They were adaptive mechanisms for behavior motivated by self-interest and inner anxieties. In September 1950 Sinatra felt particularly vulnerable. He was in a panic over his moribund career and haunted by the continual speculations and innuendos in circulation regarding his draft status in World War II. Sinatra "was scared, his career had sprung a leak." In a letter dated September 17, 1950, to <a href="/wiki/Clyde_Tolson" title="Clyde Tolson">Clyde Tolson</a>, Deputy FBI Director, Sinatra offered to be of service to the FBI as an informer. An excerpted passage from a memo in FBI files states that Sinatra "feels he can be of help as a result of going anywhere the Bureau desires and contacting any people from whom he might be able to obtain information. Sinatra feels as a result of his publicity he can operate without suspicion&#160;... he is willing to go the whole way." The FBI declined his assistance.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaplan_28-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kaplan-28">[28]</a></sup><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:Rp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Rp (page does not exist)">Template:Rp</a>
