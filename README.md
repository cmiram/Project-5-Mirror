# To build and run
First, run "make build" in the project root. This will set all the necessary scripts to be executable.
To deploy to the servers with pre-configured defaults, run the `startCDN` script.
`deployCDN` will deploy with the given arguments to all the replica servers and the DNS server.
`runCDN` will run with the given arguments on all the replica servers and the dns server
`stopCDN` will stop them all (including the DNS server)

Networks Grad project 5

Our code is split into two python projects. One for the DNS server and another for the http server.
The http server runs a socket on the specified port to listen for clients requesting data. When 
it receives a request it checks the cache for a matching path and if it finds one it returns that data.
The server keeps track of two caches, one static containing the most popular zipf pages and a second 
runtime cache that adds items as they're requested, but all this data is lost on a server restart.
If not it requests it from the server and adds it to the runtime cache before returning it to the client. 
If the cache is full it deletes items in the cache until it stays within the memory limits.

The DNS server also opens a socket and listens in an infinite loop for a client query. When it gets a 
request it encodes the http header info and returns the requested information to the client. If the 
client is new the DNS server picks a replica that is the closest geographically to the client.
